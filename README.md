# üçï Pizza Sales SQL Analysis

Welcome to the **Pizza Sales SQL Analysis** repository!  
This project explores key business insights from a pizza sales dataset using structured SQL queries.

## üìä Project Overview

This repository contains SQL scripts designed to extract meaningful insights from a pizza store's sales data. The goal is to demonstrate practical examples of SQL in action for business analysis, focusing on:

- Total orders and sales revenue
- Best-selling and highest-priced pizzas
- Customer purchasing patterns by pizza size and type
